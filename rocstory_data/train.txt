<s>Automated text summarization through machine learning </s> can be an extremely valuable tool to increase efficiency in both our everyday life and professional endeavours if the important information in a document can be extracted and accurately summarized. 
The typical person consumes a wide variety of information every day - news articles, social media posts , work emails, study material, etc -and spends a large amount of time and energy reading and digesting the content. Busy professionals don’t have time to individually read through hundreds or thousands of long, tedious documents — you need summaries to quickly glance through and see what each document is about before going into deeper analysis.
<s>The process of providing key points of a text and eliminating redundant parts is called ‘ Document Summarisation ’ </s>. People in different lines of business normally struggle to read a huge number of documents they receive on a daily basis. It is therefore useful to summarise and extract key information from a document.
Since the first paper about document summarization was published in 1958 by Luhn, et. al, various techniques have been developed to successfully extract the important contents from a text document. The text summarization research field is a blossoming area of natural language processing (NLP), especially in recent years with implementation of neural networks in conjunction with cloud computing capabilities.
Document summarization is an interesting machine learning field that is increasingly gaining traction. As research in this area continues, we can expect to see breakthroughs that will assist in fluently and accurately shortening long text documents.

'' here , inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they 're ready to appear in court . most often , they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer -- charges that judge steven leifman says are usually `` avoidable felonies . '' he says the arrests often result from confrontations with police . mentally ill people often wo n't do what they 're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid , delusional , and less likely to follow directions , according to leifman . so , they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed , but not getting any real help because they 're in jail . we toured the jail with leifman . he is well known in miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill . even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards , we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor . go inside the ` forgotten floor ' '' at first , it 's hard to determine where the people are . the prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes . imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that 's kind of what they look like . they 're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves . that 's also why they have no shoes , laces or mattresses . leifman says about one-third of all people in miami-dade county jails are mentally ill . so , he says , the sheer volume is overwhelming the system , and the result is what we see on the ninth floor . of course , it is a jail , so it 's not supposed to be warm and comforting , but the lights glare , the cells are tiny and it 's loud . we see two , sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes , sometimes naked , lying or sitting in their cells . `` i am the son of the president . you need to get me out of here ! '' one man shouts at me . he is absolutely serious , convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the white house . leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system , occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital , only to return to jail to face their charges . it 's brutally unjust , in his mind , and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in miami . over a meal later , we talk about how things got this way for mental patients . leifman says 200 years ago people were considered `` lunatics '' and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them . they were just considered unfit to be in society . over the years , he says , there was some public outcry , and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals . but leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down . where did the patients go ? nowhere . the streets . they became , in many cases , the homeless , he says . they never got treatment . leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals , and today that number has been reduced 90 percent , and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals . the judge says he 's working to change this . starting in 2008 , many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the `` forgotten floor '' will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment , not just punishment . leifman says it 's not the complete answer , but it 's a start . leifman says the best part is that it 's a win-win solution . the patients win , the families are relieved , and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again . and , for leifman , justice is served . e-mail to a friend .

'' the white house is billing the speech , along with another address next week to the american legion , as an effort to `` provide broader context '' for the debate over the upcoming iraq progress report by gen. david petraeus , the top u.s. military commander , and ryan crocker , the u.s. ambassador in baghdad . president bush has frequently asked lawmakers -- and the american people -- to withhold judgment on his troop `` surge '' in iraq until the report comes out in september . watch bush criticize the iraqi government '' it is being closely watched on capitol hill , particularly by republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war . earlier this month , defense secretary robert gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160,000 u.s. troops in iraq might begin . bush 's speeches wednesday and next week are the latest in a series of attempts by the white house to try to reframe the debate over iraq , as public support for the war continues to sag . a recent cnn/opinion research corporation poll found that almost two-thirds of americans -- 64 percent -- now oppose the iraq war , and 72 percent say that even if petraeus reports progress , it wo n't change their opinion . the poll also found a great deal of skepticism about the report ; 53 percent said they do not trust petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in iraq . in addition to his analogy to vietnam , bush in wednesday 's speech will invoke other historical comparisons from asia , including the u.s. defeat and occupation of japan after world war ii and the korean war in the 1950s , according to the excerpts . `` in the aftermath of japan 's surrender , many thought it naive to help the japanese transform themselves into a democracy . then , as now , the critics argued that some people were simply not fit for freedom , '' bush will say . `` today , in defiance of the critics , japan ... stands as one of the world 's great free societies . '' speaking about the korean war , bush will note that at the time `` critics argued that the war was futile , that we never should have sent our troops in , or that america 's intervention was divisive here at home . '' `` while it is true that the korean war had its share of challenges , america never broke its word , '' bush will say . `` without america 's intervention during the war , and our willingness to stick with the south koreans after the war , millions of south koreans would now be living under a brutal and repressive regime .

'' this could explain why bees in australia may be resistant to colony collapse . `` there are no cases ... in australia at all , '' entomologist dave britton of the australian museum told the sydney morning herald last month . `` it is a northern hemisphere phenomenon . '' bee ecology expert and university of florida professor jamie ellis said earlier this year that genetic weakness bred into bees over time , pathogens spread by parasites and the effects of pesticides and pollutants might be other factors . researchers also say varroa mites affect all hives on the u.s. mainland but are not found in australia . university of georgia bee researcher keith s. delaplane said thursday the study offers a warning -- and hope . `` one nagging problem has been a general inability to treat or vaccinate bees against viruses of any kind , '' said delaplane , who has been trying to breed bees resistant to the varroa mite . `` but in the case of iapv , there is evidence that some bees carry genetic resistance to the disorder . this is yet one more argument for beekeepers to use honey bee stocks that are genetically disease - and pest-resistant . '' bee researchers will now look for stresses that may combine to kill bees . `` the next step is to ascertain whether iapv , alone or in concert with other factors , can induce ccd -lsb- colony collapse disorder -rsb- in healthy bees , '' said ian lipkin , director of the center for infection and immunity at columbia university mailman school of public health . besides the columbia and usda researchers , others involved in the study released thursday include researchers from pennsylvania state university , the pennsylvania department of agriculture , the university of arizona and 454 life sciences . e-mail to a friend .

<s> because of troubles , lindsay lohan likely difficult to insure . </s> <s> lohan supposed to appear in shirley maclaine film `` poor things '' </s> <s> insurance rates may cost 1 to 3 percent of film 's production budget . </s><sec>los angeles , california -lrb- reuters -rrb- -- `` to insure or not to insure ? '' it is n't shakespeare , but it is the dramatic question hollywood filmmakers are asking about lindsay lohan following her legal troubles this week . lindsay lohan may still get work after her legal problems are settled , but the cost will be high . it is an important question , too , because whether companies insure lohan 's future movies may determine whether she will quickly fall off hollywood 's a-list . but lohan fans have little to fear because no actor is uninsurable , say underwriting experts . while some producers may balk at conditions for hiring problematic stars , experts say that unless an actor is serving time in prison , even the most volatile can be covered -- albeit at a high cost . `` for a price , anything can be done , although an insurance carrier can make things so unpalatable that at times the makers of the film just wo n't be interested , '' said ross miller , partner with insurance brokerage d.r. reiff & associates inc. . lohan 's arrest this week in los angeles on suspicion of drunken driving and cocaine possession has left hollywood wondering if the actress , who shot to fame as a child in disney films like `` the parent trap , '' is too risky to cast in a film . timeline : lindsay lohan 's troubles '' it remains to be seen whether her latest relapse and brush with the law will cost her a role in `` poor things , '' a film produced by and starring oscar-winner shirley maclaine . see a gallery of lohan 's films '' a statement was expected early next week on whether the movie , already delayed this spring due to an earlier rehab stint by lohan , will proceed with or without her . insurance experts say the industry has long dealt with similar situations , although they may seem more frequent with the recent heavy media scrutiny of lohan and fellow troubled party girls paris hilton and britney spears . `` i do n't think it -lrb- a problematic artist -rrb- is any more of an issue , '' said wendy diaz , entertainment underwriting director at fireman 's fund insurance co. , the leading film underwriter . `` it 's pretty standard year to year . '' but diaz did say the terms for covering lohan would likely be `` serious at this point . '' she said fireman 's fund , in such a case , would likely put in higher deductibles , or ask the star to put their salary into escrow to pay for any losses if production was disrupted . last july , a producer on lohan 's last film , `` georgia rule , '' scolded her publicly for repeatedly showing up late on the set , costing the movie 's makers hundreds of thousands of dollars . brian kingman , a managing director with entertainment insurance broker aon/albert g. ruben said covering situations like lohan 's required a lot of calculation and risk management . insurance rates for errant actors can range anywhere from 1 percent to 3 percent of a movie 's production budget , which can range from $ 5 million to $ 100 million or more , he said . `` filmmakers fall in love with certain actors for certain roles and my job is to find risk-takers to take on the risk , '' kingman said . he said actors were always required to undergo a medical exam before getting insurance . in certain circumstances , drug screening is conducted and actors are required to provide blood and urine samples . in cases of known drug abuse , `` minders '' are sometimes required on set to keep an eye on the actor . kingman said he had even helped craft policies for actors in the event they risked the possibility of incarceration . `` i have been successful in finding and creating incarceration coverage for certain actors on probation which can be revoked if they break certain rules , '' he said , citing the case of robert downey jr. , another high-profile star with a history of legal , drug and alcohol problems . e-mail to a friend . copyright 2007 reuters . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed .
<s> several famous songs written by men for a woman . </s> <s> beethoven 's `` für elise '' may have been written `` for therese '' </s> <s> songwriters make up stories about who is behind `` 867-5309 / jenny '' </s><sec>1 . `` für elise '' bob dylan wrote `` it ai n't me , babe '' for joan baez . written by : ludwig van beethoven . written for : some girl probably not named elise . in fact , as far as most historians can tell , beethoven did n't even know an elise . instead , the song was originally titled `` bagatelle in a minor '' based on some handwritten notation a beethoven researcher claimed to have seen on a now-lost copy of the sheet music . further complicating things , beethoven had hideous handwriting -- to the point that some scholars speculate the song was actually written `` for therese , '' as in therese malfatti , one of several women who turned down a marriage proposal from the notoriously lovesick maestro . 2 . `` philadelphia freedom '' written by : elton john & bernie taupin . written for : billie jean king , as a thank-you for a tracksuit she gave elton . and what a tracksuit it must have been ! the 1975 song remains one of the most popular disco hits ever , leaving thousands of hustle enthusiasts wondering just what billie jean king had to do with philadelphia , anyway . turns out , the song was a reference to king 's pro tennis team , the philadelphia freedoms . prior to 1968 , tennis players were all considered `` amateurs '' and were n't eligible to receive prize money . so , if you did n't have the wealth to support yourself , you could n't play . billie jean king fought against those constraints , ultimately founding professional world team tennis in 1974 and turning tennis into a paid league sport . 3 . `` lola '' written by : the kinks ' ray davies . written for : a transvestite . but the question is , which one ? according to rolling stone , `` lola '' was inspired by candy darling , a member of andy warhol 's entourage , whom ray davies briefly -lrb- and cluelessly -rrb- dated . if that 's the case , then `` lola '' is just another notch on darling 's song belt -- she 's also referred to in lou reed 's `` walk on the wild side . '' -lrb- `` candy came from out on the island / in the backroom she was everybody 's darlin ' . '' -rrb- . but , in the kinks ' official biography , davies tells a different story . he says `` lola '' was written after the band 's manager spent a very drunken night dancing with a woman whose five o'clock shadow was apparently obvious to everyone but him . 4 . `` 867-5309 / jenny '' written by : jim keller -lrb- of tommy tutone -rrb- and alex call . written for : unknown , as the songwriters apparently make up a different story about its inspiration every time they 're asked . while the woman continues to remain a mystery , however , the phone number is all too real . in fact , it 's been wreaking havoc ever since 1982 and the passage of time has n't quelled of the number of crank calls . in 1999 , brown university freshman roommates nina clemente and jahanaz mirza found that out the hard way , when the school adopted an 867 exchange number for its on-campus phone system . immediately , the girls ' innocuous room no. 5309 became a magnet for every drunk college kid with a 1980s fetish . other unfortunate phone customers have fought back with creative and profitable solutions , like the holder of 212-867-5309 , who put his phone number up for auction on ebay in 2004 . bids approached $ 100,000 before ebay pulled the item at the request of verizon , the number 's actual owner . 5 . `` oh , carol '' written by : neil sedaka . written for : carole king , naturally . sedaka and king actually dated briefly in high school -- a romance sedaka was able to successfully milk with `` oh , carol , '' a then top-10 -lrb- if now somewhat forgettable -rrb- 1959 pop song . however , the real success of `` oh , carol '' came a few months later , when it inspired king to write a rebuttal entitled `` oh , neil . '' at the time , king and her husband , gerry goffin , were fledgling songwriters in need of a hit tune . `` oh , neil '' was n't that , but it did pay off . after sedaka gave a tape of the song to his boss , king and goffin landed jobs at the legendary brill building pop music factory , where the duo went on to write chart-toppers like `` will you still love me tomorrow '' and `` the loco-motion . '' 6 . `` it ai n't me , babe '' written by : bob dylan . written for : joan baez , though it clearly was n't the nicest gift dylan could have given her . the two met in 1961 , when baez was an up-and-coming folk singer and dylan was a nobody from minnesota . desperate to make his break in the music biz , dylan worked like crazy to get baez 's attention . he eventually ended up going on tour with her , which is how he first became famous , and also how the two began dating . for a while , they seemed like the golden couple , but things soon went downhill . during a european concert tour together in early 1965 , they had a huge fight and parted ways . that may , dylan was holed up in a hotel after being hospitalized with a virus , and baez , hoping to remain friends , decided to bring him flowers . sadly , that 's how she found out that her ex was already dating someone else . that someone else was sara lownds , whom dylan married a mere six months later . 7 . `` our house '' written by : graham nash -lrb- of crosby , stills , nash & young -rrb- . written for : joni mitchell . in december 1968 , nash and mitchell moved into a cozy little house in the laurel canyon section of los angeles . though commonly left out of the hippy pantheon , laurel canyon was sort of a commune-home away from commune-home for san francisco society -- not just csn&y , but also jim morrison , the eagles , frank zappa , and more . `` our house '' was directly inspired by a lazy sunday in the nash/mitchell household . the couple went out to brunch , hit an antiques store , and then returned to find the house just a bit chilly , at which point nash literally `` lit a fire , '' while mitchell `` placed the flowers in the vase that she bought that day . '' no , really . the whole tableau seemed so ridiculously domestic to nash that he immediately sat down and spent the rest of the day writing about it . e-mail to a friend .

'' spider-man said after the boy mimicked his wrist movement . other superheroes crowded around to get a closer look . even the green goblin stopped his villainous ways to tell the boy hi . youssif remained unfazed . he did n't take a liking to spider-man 's nemesis . spidey was just too cool . `` it was my favorite thing , '' the boy said later . `` i want to see him again . '' he then felt compelled to add : `` i know it 's not the real spider-man . '' this was the day of dreams when the boy 's nightmares were , at least temporarily , forgotten . he met spongebob , lassie and a 3-year-old orangutan named archie . the hairy , brownish-red primate took to the boy , grabbing his hand and holding it . even when youssif pulled away , archie would inch his hand back toward the boy 's and then snatch it . see youssif enjoy being a boy again '' the boy giggled inside a play area where sponge-like balls shot out of toy guns . it was a far different artillery than what he was used to seeing in central baghdad , as recently as a week ago . he squealed with delight and raced around the room collecting as many balls as he could . he rode a tram through the back stages at universal studios . at one point , the car shook . fire and smoke filled the air , debris cascaded down and a big rig skidded toward the vehicle . the boy and his family survived the pretend earthquake unscathed . `` even i was scared , '' the dad said . `` well , i was n't , '' youssif replied . the father and mother grinned from ear to ear throughout the day . youssif pushed his 14-month-old sister , ayaa , in a stroller . `` did you even need to ask us if we were interested in coming here ?

'' nichols responded , `` that is what we believe , yes . '' watch simpson transferred sunday in handcuffs '' the alleged victims were identified as bruce fromong , a sports memorabilia collector who described the incident as `` a home invasion-type robbery , '' and alfred beardsley , who has been quoted by celebrity web site tmz.com as saying that simpson later apologized to him and told him he regretted the incident . acting on a tip , police met over the weekend at mccarran international airport with 46-year-old walter alexander , of mesa , arizona , who told them about the alleged robbery and validated the tipster 's information , capt. james dillon told reporters . alexander was arrested saturday night on two counts of robbery with a deadly weapon , two counts of assault with a deadly weapon , conspiracy to commit robbery and burglary with a deadly weapon . he was released on his own recognizance and returned to mesa either saturday night or early sunday morning , dillon said . in addition , investigators are seeking four other men they believe accompanied simpson into the hotel room , nichols said . nichols said , `` there is a social relationship between the individuals that we identified and o.j. simpson . '' though simpson is not accused of having brandished a gun himself , two firearms that police said were used were recovered early sunday in one of three searches . investigators would would not divulge where the weapons were found . nichols dismissed an initial report that the men may have been off-duty police . `` there is no truth to that whatsoever , '' he said . `` that came as a result of some language that was used when the individuals burst into the room that led our victims to believe that they may have been police . '' simpson , 60 , has acknowledged taking some items that belonged to him , but he has denied that any weapons were involved . `` whether the property belonged to mr. simpson or not is still in debate , '' nichols said . `` we are still in the process of sorting that out . '' nichols also said that some of the property taken had simpson 's signature . but `` there was some other property taken as well , '' he said . `` i believe there were some joe montana cleats and some signed baseballs and other stuff . '' the latest charges against simpson mean he faces the prospect of another prosecution , more than a decade after the june 1994 stabbing deaths of his ex-wife , nicole brown simpson , and ron goldman . simpson was acquitted of murder the following year . the trial riveted much of the united states . but in 1997 , a jury found him liable for the deaths in a civil case brought by the goldman family . simpson was ordered to pay the families a total of $ 33.5 million for the deaths . goldman had gone to nicole simpson 's los angeles home to return a pair of glasses the day of the slayings . goldman 's sister , kim goldman , said she was n't surprised by the robbery allegations , since simpson `` thinks he can do no wrong . '' `` he 's capable of stabbing people to death , so i think robbery is nothing surprising , '' she said . `` normal , logical , civil-minded , law-abiding people do n't storm a room with guns demanding stuff back . '' fromong had testified on simpson 's behalf in the civil case , telling the court that prices for simpson memorabilia had dropped substantially since the 1995 verdict . his testimony was part of the defense 's contention that simpson could not afford to pay the goldmans . simpson recently wrote a book originally titled `` if i did it '' and had planned to publish it himself , but a public outcry led to the cancellation of his book deal . a bankruptcy judge subsequently awarded the goldmans the rights to the book in light of their inability to collect the wrongful death award . the goldmans retitled the book , `` if i did it : confessions of the killer .

'' the transfer took place january 26 , the indictment alleges . oakley is also charged with converting the material and `` restricted data '' to his own use . he began doing so on about october 17 , 2006 , and continued through january , prosecutors said . prosecutors said the materials involved have been examined by scientists and posed no threat to people who may have come into contact with them . oakley 's attorney , herb moncier , said outside court thursday that oakley 's job was to break rods `` into little pieces '' and throw them away . moncier said oakley had a security clearance , but moncier did not believe it was a high-level clearance . the government alleges that in january , oakley attempted to sell the `` pieces of scrap '' to someone he thought was a french agent -- but in reality was an undercover fbi agent , moncier said . he said he questions whether those broken pieces would be considered an `` appliance '' under the law . `` mr. oakley has cooperated fully for the last six months , '' said moncier , who added that he had traveled to washington for work on the case . each count carries a possible sentence upon conviction of up to 10 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine . `` while none of the stolen equipment was ever transmitted to a foreign government or terrorist organization , the facts of this case demonstrate the importance of safeguarding our nuclear technology and pursuing aggressive prosecution against those who attempt to breach the safeguards and put that technology in the wrong hands , '' kenneth wainstein , assistant attorney general for national security , said in the justice department statement . one government source said the materials involved are not the `` crown jewels , '' but they should not have been taken from the facility . a `` barrier '' is used to filter uranium during the enrichment process , according to nuclear energy officials , but a significant number of barriers are needed to do that job . sources told cnn that federal authorities have been following oakley and investigating the case for at least six months , after he allegedly tried to sell the classified material . oakley , described as a low-level employee , apparently did not make contact with any foreign government and is not a foreign agent of any kind , an official familiar with the case said . a government official with with knowledge of the case said that when authorities learned of oakley 's alleged intentions six months ago , the fbi and department of energy launched a joint investigation . the fbi then developed a sting operation , government officials familiar with the case said , and authorities intervened before there could be any involvement of a foreign country . east tennessee technology park is an area of the doe 's oak ridge reservation `` where we are currently decontaminating and decommissioning buildings that were last used in 1985 , '' gerald boyd , manager of the doe 's oak ridge site office , said thursday . `` when they were in use , now over 20 years ago , some of the buildings at ettp housed facilities used for the enrichment of uranium .

<s> organ shortage in rich states has created a trade from poorer countries . </s> <s> `` transplant tourists '' travel to poor countries to buy organs from the desperate . </s> <s> pakistan , where trade in human organs is legal , is turning into a `` kidney bazaar '' </s> <s> patients pay $ 8,500 for a new kidney , while donors are paid just $ 300 to $ 1,000 . </s><sec>hong kong , china -lrb- reuters -rrb- -- paul lee got his liver from an executed chinese prisoner ; karam in egypt bought a kidney for his sister for $ 5,300 ; in istanbul hakan is holding out for $ 30,700 for one of his kidneys . doctors in pakistan have been arrested for abducting people , drugging them and stealing their kidneys . they are not so unusual : a dire shortage of donated organs in rich countries is sending foreigners with end-stage illnesses to poorer places like china , pakistan , turkey , egypt , colombia and the philippines to buy a new lease of life . lee , a 53-year-old chief subway technician in hong kong , was diagnosed with liver cancer in january 2005 but doctors denied him a transplant because they feared the tumor would spread . a friend told him about a transplant hospital in china 's north eastern tianjin city and he signed up for a place . that april , he paid 260,000 yuan -lrb- $ 34,380 -rrb- for a transplant -- surgery that saved his life . `` the hospital has connections with a lot of prisons , '' lee told reuters . `` mine came from an executed prisoner from heilongjiang . i thank the donor deeply . '' the world health organization estimates that 21,000 liver transplants are carried out annually , but medical experts put annual worldwide demand at at least 90,000 . demand for kidneys also exceeds supply , and that has given rise to organ trafficking and a black market for rich people and `` transplant tourists '' who travel to poor countries to buy body parts from people with few other routes to a better living . a donor in south africa receives $ 700 for a kidney compared with $ 30,000 in the united states . a lack of transparency and little protection for donors has spurred calls by international bodies to crack down on , or at least regulate , the trade . but even where the trade is banned , laws are often muddled or laced with loopholes , which are sometimes defended by vested interests . and the unregulated route is much less complicated for the recipient . any transplant procedure involving a living donor carries risks for the donor -- especially for liver transplants which involve removing part of the donor 's liver . the complications can include bleeding , infection , even death . in the transplant trade , the recipient need not worry about , for example , exposing a living relative to that risk . `` it is cheaper and your next of kin is not taking the risk and you do n't have to care for someone you do n't know . once you pay , it is discarded in a way , it is dispensable , '' said luc noel , a geneva-based coordinator for clinical procedures at the world health organization . china recently banned the sale of human organs and restricted transplants for foreigners , saying it must first meet demand at home for 2 million organs a year . only 20,000 transplants are carried out in china each year . of these , 3,000 are liver transplants and 95 percent of them use livers from dead donors . china defended its use of organs from executed prisoners , saying consent was obtained from convicts or their families . a transplant operation using the liver of a dead donor costs around $ 33,000 in china . `` what is important is the transparency , it has to be open to scrutiny ... if china makes its current system open to scrutiny and very transparent , that would do good , '' said the who 's noel . in asia , a cultural obsession with keeping the body of the deceased intact has stymied public organ donation programs . excluding china , asia has fewer than 200 livers donated by people ahead of their death each year , said lo chung-man , professor of hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery at the university of hong kong . pakistan , where trade in human organs is not illegal , is turning into a `` kidney bazaar '' , said the chief executive of pakistan 's kidney foundation , jaffar naqvi . there are no confirmed figures for the number of foreigners coming to the country for new kidneys but naqvi said there were 13 centers in lahore alone which reported more than 2,000 transplants last year from bought kidneys . patients , mostly from europe , saudi arabia and india , pay about 500,000 rupees -lrb- $ 8,500 -rrb- for a new kidney , he said . donors are paid $ 300 to $ 1,000 and often get no medical care after the surgery . there is no consent in some cases . in may police arrested nine people , four of them doctors , for abducting people , drugging them and stealing their kidneys for transplant operations . in the pipeline is a draft law aimed at banning the trade , but a powerful lobby bent on preserving it is trying to ensure it allows kidney donations for a non-relative , with no payment . such a clause allowing `` altruistic '' organ donations will ensure the trade continues with secret payment to donors , naqvi said . stories of people selling their organs , especially kidneys , are not uncommon in egypt , where more than 30 percent of a population of more than 73 million people live below the poverty line . karam , who asked to be identified only by his first name because organ trading is illegal , said it took him only 15 days to secure a kidney for his sister who was suffering from kidney failure . he said a doctor found him a man willing to sell his kidney for 30,000 egyptian pounds -lrb- $ 5,300 -rrb- . `` the fees of the doctor were 5,000 pounds . both his money and the fees of the hospital were deducted from the money the ` donor ' received , '' said karam . he said doctors usually help in finding people willing to sell their organs from their patients ' lists . abdel-kader hegazy , head of the disciplinary committee at the doctors ' union , said egyptian law lacks clear punishment for those involved in illegal transplants , making it easy for doctors to repeat the offence . `` the law says it is illegal to trade in organs but does not specify the punishment . we at the union suspended many doctors and closed their practices , but they have appealed before courts and won their licenses back , '' he told reuters . `` it is an annoying and a regrettable situation . well-known doctors and professors are doing this . they are rich people but they do it because they have no moral values . '' the union has been pushing for legislation to regulate organ transplants , with a draft bill including heavy fines and a prison sentence for those involved and a ban on transplants between people of different nationalities . but the draft law has been languishing in parliament for several years because of differences between doctors and senior muslim religious leaders on whether islam allows organ transplants in the case of clinical deaths . in turkey , students , unemployed young men and struggling fathers post adverts on the internet selling their kidneys , listing their drinking and smoking habits and blood type . these would-be donors say they have had enquiries from germany , israel and turkey with asking prices going up to 50,000 lira -lrb- $ 38,760 -rrb- . hakan , a 27-year-old security guard in istanbul with two young children who also requested only his first name be published , told reuters he received five or six offers from turkey and germany , offering 10,000-15 ,000 lira -lrb- $ 11,600 -rrb- , but he 's holding out for 40,000 lira . `` of course it 's frightening but there 's nothing else to be done , '' he said , adding he had n't told his wife as he knew she would object . `` i 'm doing it because of my family , if i was alone it would n't matter . i 've got two children ... there 's nothing else i can do for them .

'' the scene is an old people 's home . two residents are playing beggar my neighbor . enter the princess . the question from the royal visitor is unexpected but everyone laughs . afterwards they comment on her large eyes and what life she brought into the room . one tiny incident , characteristic of countless other occasions in the princess 's public life in which she found the right word or the right gesture to bring cheer and comfort . everyone here will have their own memories . i remember meeting princess diana for the very first time early in 1981 to discuss details of the wedding service in st paul 's . even archbishop 's chaplains have their share of proper diffidence and i was nervous entering the presence . it must have been a bewildering time for the princess as well , but even then , at the age of 20 , her capacity for empathy and her very strong intuitive power ensured that any tension soon evaporated . prince harry has spoken movingly and justly , as few others have the right to do , about the princess as a mother . i want to dwell for a moment on her public work , its cost and its meaning . after her marriage , the princess joined her natural gifts of beauty , empathy and powerful intuition with that extraordinary charge which association with the royal family generates . led by our queen and other members of the royal family , our constitution has developed in response to the challenges of the past century . there is a properly political sphere in which the monarch may counsel but does n't intrude , but there is another sphere , vital to any sense of national unity and creativity , a sphere in which communities must be celebrated , common values articulated and the transcendent source of those values honored . we tend to be suspicious of public figures who wrap themselves in divinity and claim that their will is god 's will , but if no-one can articulate in an un-ignorable way in the public realm the creative energy of the love that we see in christ , the human face of god , then we shall find ourselves inhabiting a maimed and diminished society . and at a time when people are suspicious of rhetoric , the monarchy communicates by symbol and by simple speech , and the princess brought her own gifts to this work . she was still only 26 in 1987 when she shook the hand of a patient at the opening of the middlesex hospital 's aids ward . it was the first in the uk and it is very hard now to credit the degree of fear and prejudice which surrounded aids in the '80s . those familiar with the field have no doubt that the princess played a significant part in overcoming a harmful and even a cruel taboo in a gesture which was not choreographed but sprung from a deep identification with those who were vulnerable and on the margin . and she had a similar impact in the usa . an editorial in the new york times in 1989 admitted ruefully that it had taken a foreign , and even a royal , dignitary to draw attention to a major public health concern in the us . her work in the very last year of her life for the victims of landmines also caught the popular imagination internationally and certainly accelerated the adoption of the ottawa convention , banning the use of a weapon which disproportionately kills and maims women and children . she proved the eloquence of embrace and of touch which , of course , have been used by royal healers throughout the centuries . and as she said , in her words , `` the biggest disease today is not leprosy or tb but the feeling of being unwanted '' . she sought out places of suffering , because they are so very often places of truth where the masks have been removed , and she was not afraid to be with the dying and to comfort them in an unsentimental way . bill deedes accompanied her on some of her visits . his response to the cynics was typically robust . he said : `` she was one who sought above all to help vulnerable people in society and who did it so well . she was good at this because she herself was vulnerable . she knew the feeling . she did n't set out to be a saint . '' the role brought great power but , like any member of the royal family , she also experienced the weight of expectation and the intensity of the scrutiny . honoring but managing the role and not allowing it to take over one 's personal humanity is a desperately difficult task . as we have heard from prince harry , his mother diana did all that she could to prepare her sons for the work which lies ahead . she confessed to receiving a very great deal from some of those whose lives she touched . she said of john , a young greek suffering from cystic fibrosis : `` he showed no sign of anger , no trace of bitterness but touched us all with an aura of optimism and hope for the future such that i have never before encountered . '' the love of christ described in the lesson read by prince william contains the essence of the spiritual life . princess diana recognized this quality of life in many of those , like john , whose lives she touched . it was a mystery which resonated deeply with her and for which she reached out . and the mystery is this - the more you go beyond yourself , the more you will become your true self ; the more you lose yourself in loving and serving others , the more you will find yourself ; the more you keep company with those who suffer , the more you will be healed . this is the knowledge which passes all understanding . this is certain and has been proved experimentally in the life of all the saints . it 's easy to lose the real person in the image , to insist that all is darkness or all is light . still , 10 years after her tragic death , there are regular reports of `` fury '' at this or that incident , and the princess 's memory is used for scoring points . let it end here . let this service mark the point at which we let her rest in peace and dwell on her memory with thanksgiving and compassion . let us also , echoing the words of prince harry , look to the future and pray , in the words of st paul , for all those who serve our country as members of the royal family and most especially for the sons who were so precious to her : . `` i pray that you being rooted and established in love may have power with all the saints to grasp what is the breadth and length and depth and height of the love of christ and to know this love which surpasses knowledge that you might be filled with the fullness of god .

'' `` he said the facts were fudged , '' moore said , referring to gupta , on cnn 's `` larry king live . '' `` that 's a lie . none of the facts are fudged . '' moore and gupta shouted and argued over data gupta used and data moore used . moore said his staffers backed up the film 's facts to gupta before the report aired and that gupta aired it knowing his facts were wrong . gupta disputed that . watch moore , gupta make their points '' `` we try and look for some of the best sources we can possibly find , '' he said . `` michael has a lot of different numbers . ... you 're sort of cherry-picking data from different reports . '' both agreed , however , on the basic premise of `` sicko '' : problems abound in america 's health-care system and need to be fixed . `` i thought it was a good movie , and i wanted to say that , '' gupta said . `` i think it strikes at the irrefutable fact -- it 's broken . we get it . '' he praised moore for raising awareness of the issue . however , gupta said he was concerned that the movie -- which notes that other developed nations such as france and canada have universal health care -- suggests that health care in those countries is free . while patients may not pay for services at the doctor 's office , they do pay high taxes to fund such a system , something gupta said he was concerned that `` sicko '' audiences might not realize . moore responded by saying americans pay more in copays , deductibles and insurance premiums . `` we -lsb- america -rsb- have a system built on profit , '' the moviemaker said . he asked gupta if the current system , which requires him to receive approval from an insurance company before performing some procedures , is cumbersome to him . `` it 's a shameful system , especially when i 'm dealing with some of my patients , '' gupta said . but he questioned moore 's apparent solution -- putting health care in the hands of the bush administration , which moore fiercely criticized in the past , particularly in his film `` fahrenheit 9/11 .

<s> french fm kouchner has told france to prepare for possibility of war with iran . </s> <s> was a surprise appointment to nicolas sarkozy 's conservative government . </s> <s> also the first french foreign minister to visit iraq since 1988 . </s> <s> founder of medicins sans frontiers , also french student leader in may 1968 . </s><sec>london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- french foreign minister bernard kouchner 's declaration that france had to prepare for the possibility of war against iran over its nuclear program was not conventional diplomatic behavior . but then kouchner was never expected to be a soft-soaper on the diplomatic scene . french foreign minister bernard kouchner has a reputation for challenging convention and authority . a surprise appointment from the socialist ranks to nicolas sarkozy 's conservative government , the founder of medicins sans frontiers has always challenged convention and authority . the former un secretary general boutros boutros-ghali once called kouchner ` an unguided missile ' and the man himself has been known to declare : `` to change the law you sometimes have to break the law '' . he was in his youth one of the leaders of the students revolt in france in may 1968 . kouchner is a humanitarian as well as a patriot , with a strong commitment to human rights . unusually for a man of the left , he supported the us-led intervention in iraq -lrb- while criticizing the aftermath -rrb- . but he did so on the grounds of saddam hussein 's denial of human rights , not his possible possession of weapons of mass destruction . his and president sarkozy 's concern for human rights lies behind their eagerness to join gordon brown 's britain in a new push for action in darfur . bernard kouchner did not come to his position with any of former president chirac 's instinctive distrust of the united states . washington , which has been critical of some european states for their weakness in confronting teheran , will have been delighted by his ` get serious ' warning to teheran . but the plain-speaking kouchner is unlikely to be deterred by fears of upsetting the white house when he has criticisms to make of us policy . how much should be made of his words on iran remains unclear at this stage . they were scarcely on the same scale as president chirac 's threat when he was still in office to retaliate with nuclear strikes against any state found to be responsible for a large-scale terrorist attack on france . but they are all of a piece with france 's new high-profile style under the presidency of nicolas sarkozy . mr kouchner , for example , became the first french foreign minister to visit iraq since 1988 , insisting that there could only be a political solution to the country 's problems , not a military one , and offering france 's services as a mediator and ` honest broker ' between sunnis , shiites and kurds . on iran he is , in a way , merely echoing the words of his president who declared in a speech last month that a nuclear-armed iran would be ` unacceptable ' and describing the stand-off over its nuclear program as ` undoubtedly the most serious crisis before us today ' . certainly mr kouchner is making clear that france no longer takes the view once expressed by president chirac that a nuclear-armed iran might be inevitable . in continuing to ratchet up the rhetoric over that threat and to underline the west 's resolution on iran 's nuclear enrichment program mr kouchner is supplementing his president 's warnings . neither is saying that military intervention against iran is imminent or inevitable . neither has yet confirmed that france would be part of any such military action . but both are stressing the risks which are piling up as a result of teheran 's brinkmanship . perhaps the strongest lesson though from mr kouchner 's intervention is his underlining that the new administration in france is not a knee-jerk anti-american one -- and that france is in the business of reclaiming a role at the top diplomatic tables . e-mail to a friend .

'' democratic rep. ike skelton , the chairman of the house armed services committee , announced his opposition to the resolution last week . and democratic reps. alcee hastings of florida and john tanner of tennessee , both members of the u.s. house delegation to nato , urged pelosi to reconsider in a letter released tuesday . `` more than half of the cargo flown into iraq and afghanistan comes through incirlik air base , and this base would be a key component of any plans for redeployment of our troops in the future , '' they wrote . lt. gen. carter ham , the director of operations for the joint chiefs of staff , said pentagon planners are looking at `` a broad range of options '' to keep food , fuel and ammunition flowing to u.s. troops in iraq if turkey blocks incirlik . `` we 're confident that we 'll find ways to do that , '' ham told reporters at the pentagon . `` there 's likely to be some increased cost and some other implications for that , and obviously we 'd prefer to maintain the access that we have . '' defense secretary robert gates echoed lawmakers ' concerns last week . `` about 70 percent of all air cargo going into iraq goes through turkey . ... about a third of the fuel that they consume goes through turkey or comes from turkey , '' gates said . he also said that 95 percent of the mine-resistant ambush-protective vehicles , or mraps , being deployed in iraq are flown through turkey . the vehicles are built to withstand roadside bombs . see incirlik 's key location '' the u.s. military issued a `` warning order '' a few days ago to ensure that alternative air crews , planes , fuel and routes are lined up if turkey stops or restricts u.s. access to incirlik , a source said . jordan and kuwait are among the alternatives the united states is considering . some fear pursuit of the resolution would also embolden the turks to attack kurdish rebels in northern iraq which could further complicate iraqi stability , u.s. officials said . incirlik offers 10,000 - and 9,000-foot runways and 57 hardened aircraft shelters , according globalsecurity.org , a source of background information about military issues . globalsecurity said incirlik has become a hub for cargo shipments to iraq , taking over for rhein-main air base in germany because it is closer to iraq , reducing the strain on troops and aircraft . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's barbara starr and deirdre walsh contributed to this report .
<s> amount almost double what was spent in 2004 election cycle . </s> <s> lower tv production costs help more candidates advertise . </s> <s> mitt romney leads presidential candidates in tv spending . </s> <s> advertisers face challenge of cutting through clutter of ads , analyst says . </s><sec>washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a wide-open presidential race and a willingness by candidates , interest groups , unions and corporations to buy tv time will lead to historic spending for political and issue-advocacy advertising in the 2008 election cycle , an analysis shows . former massachusetts gov. mitt romney has spent the most on tv advertising so far among presidential contenders . the cost to try to influence the 2008 election could exceed $ 3 billion , according to tns media intelligence/campaign media analysis group , cnn 's consultant on political television advertising . this is nearly twice as much than what was spent in 2004 when political and issue-advocacy television advertising rang in at $ 1.7 billion . in 2006 , $ 2.3 billion was spent on political and issue-advocacy tv commercials . just about every candidate running for an office from dogcatcher to president is spending the money , said evan tracey , cmag 's chief operating officer . the costs to produce a tv commercial are no longer prohibitive for local and state candidates , who are turning more and more to the airwaves to reach voters . see how spending breaks down for this year '' and interest groups have spent $ 6.2 million on tv ads so far this year for state and local ballot measures . on the national level , the cost of issue-advocacy television ad spending was $ 270 million in the first nine months of this year . subjects ranged from the iraq war to telecommunications reform . television ads on health care alone total $ 60 million . cmag estimates more than $ 3 million of the $ 270 million spent to air issue-advocacy ads this year has gone for commercials in states and districts that are likely to have competitive house and senate races in 2008 . tracey said he thinks this is just the beginning of interest groups `` pivoting from legislative advocacy mode to political mode . '' `` what we expect to see between now and the end of the primaries , and through the general election , is groups will take a more aggressive stance on their advertising and actually target candidates , '' he said . with 17 democratic and republican candidates running for president , cmag predicts that more than $ 800 million will be spent on tv ads in the battle for the white house . up to now , the political commercials have been largely focused on the early states of iowa , new hampshire and south carolina . voters in some of the 20-plus states holding nominating contests on february 5 will start seeing ads in the coming months . former massachusetts gov. mitt romney leads all candidates in tv spending , having aired his commercials more than 11,000 times this year at a cost of nearly $ 8.6 million . this is a record for the number of airings at this point in a presidential election cycle . watch how romney is way ahead in ad spending '' in contrast , one of romney 's chief rivals for the gop nomination , former new york mayor rudy giuliani , has spent nothing on television ads , but giuliani leads in the national polls and is within striking distance of the lead in several state surveys . giuliani enjoys widespread national name recognition , while romney does not . in the race for the democratic nomination , illinois sen. barack obama has spent more than $ 2.3 million on television commercials , while new york sen. hillary clinton has spent $ 1 million less and leads in both national and early state polls . new mexico gov. bill richardson has probably benefited the most in the democratic contest from the $ 2 million he has invested in his television commercials . richardson 's humorous tv ads effectively stated his experience as a lawmaker , diplomat and executive , and positioned him as a solid second-tier candidate . romney used his $ 8.6 million in television ads to introduce himself as a social and fiscal conservative to republican voters . these voters might otherwise not know much about him other than that he was the governor of the traditionally liberal massachusetts . romney is leading polls in the early voting states of iowa and new hampshire . further evidence of how romney 's television commercials have helped is in south carolina . an american research group poll of south carolina republicans in august showed romney registering at 9 percent with these influential primary voters . a month later , and with $ 350,000 worth of commercials aired in the two weeks leading up to the next poll , romney was up 17 percentage points . romney 's latest ad began airing friday in iowa , and in it he vows to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons , to boost the military by 100,000 people , to strengthen u.s. intelligence capabilities and to monitor calls into the u.s. from al qaeda . all of these issues should play well with conservatives who participate in the iowa caucuses . while only a handful of democratic candidates and romney have used the airwaves until now , tracey said he expects this to change . `` before the end of october , i suspect all the frontrunner candidates will be on the air , '' tracey said . `` as we get closer to primary day , the frontrunners will be joined by all the candidates in the race who are taking their last , best shot . '' in the fight for congress , cmag predicts that as much as $ 639 million could be spent on television advertising . democrats control the house and senate . tracey noted that cmag 's 2008 election cycle forecast does not take into account unforeseen events such as former florida rep. mark foley 's house page scandal or the september 11 terrorist attacks . `` politics is completely beholden to events , '' he said . `` events will ultimately determine how much is spent , where and when . '' what television advertising challenges do candidates and interest groups face in the coming months ? `` chances are , just as what happened in 2006 , voters will be numb after watching hundred and hundreds of ads , '' said stuart rothenberg , editor of the non-partisan rothenberg political report . `` the sheer number of ads probably dilutes their importance . after a while , the ads just become lots of chatter and an ad will have to be really good to cut through the noise .
