Automated text summarization through machine learning can be an extremely valuable tool to increase efficiency in both our everyday life and professional endeavours if the important information in a document can be extracted and accurately summarized . 
The typical person consumes a wide variety of information every day - news articles, social media posts , work emails, study material, etc -and spends a large amount of time and energy reading and digesting the content . Busy professionals don’t have time to individually read through hundreds or thousands of long, tedious documents - you need summaries to quickly glance through and see what each document is about before going into deeper analysis .
The process of providing key points of a text and eliminating redundant parts is called Document Summarisation . People in different lines of business normally struggle to read a huge number of documents they receive on a daily basis. It is therefore useful to summarise and extract key information from a document .
Since the first paper about document summarization was published in 1958 by Luhn, et . al , various techniques have been developed to successfully extract the important contents from a text document . The text summarization research field is a blossoming area of natural language processing (NLP) , especially in recent years with implementation of neural networks in conjunction with cloud computing capabilities .
Document summarization is an interesting machine learning field that is increasingly gaining traction . As research in this area continues , we can expect to see breakthroughs that will assist in fluently and accurately shortening long text documents .
